        <faqitem title="What is a hackathon?">
          Hackathons are events where students from across the country come together for a weekend of innovation and creativity. Participants have 36 hours to create anything that shows off their creativity and passion for development. You may choose any platform, programming language, or format to show your stuff. You can even present a storyboard or idea; there’s no end to the possibilities!
        </faqitem>
        <faqitem title="I have no idea how to code. Can I still attend?">
